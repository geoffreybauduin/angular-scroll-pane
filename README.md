===================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lght/angular-scroll-pane.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lght/angular-scroll-pane)

AngularJS directive to use jScrollPane https://github.com/vitch/jScrollPane

## How to install

 - With bower
	 - `bower install --save angular-scroll-pane`
 - Manually
	 - `dist/angular-jscrollpane.min.js`

## What to include

Make sure you are including `jQuery`, `Angular` and `jScrollPane` along with `angular-scroll-pane`.

## How to use this module

```
angular.module("app", ['ngJScrollPane']);
angular.module("app").controller("MyCtrl", function () {
	$scope.paneConfig = {
		verticalDragMinHeight: 40
	}
});

<html>
	<body ng-app="app">
		<div ng-controller="MyCtrl">
			<div scroll-pane scroll-config="paneConfig" id="myScrollPane">
				My content needing a scroll pane
			</div>
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

**Don't forget to specify an id (or an attribute 'scroll-name') for your scroll pane, otherwise it won't be working**

### Always scroll to top

If need just specify atribute scroll-always-top. For example, good thing for custom autocomplete list.

```
<input type="text" ng-model="someText" />
<div scroll-pane scroll-config="paneConfig" id="myScrollPane" scroll-always-top="{{someText}}">
    <div ng-repeat="item in items track by $index">
        <span>{{item}}</span>
    </div>            
</div>
```

### Reinitialize the pane

If you want to reinitialize the pane, you can broadcast `reinit-pane` with the ID of the DOM Element.
